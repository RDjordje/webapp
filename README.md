1. Install MongoDB
2. Make db named persons
3. Install packages and start the express.js web service (npm install && npm start)
4. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/persons


How to use it?

The root of our webapp goes to the express.js landing page, but there is a schema created for a new object called persons.
To access persons, follow the route that is already in place by going to http://localhost:3000/persons.
Add a new person by going to http://localhost:3000/persons/new
After submitting, this will take you back to the index page where you can now Show or Edit or Delete that person record from the UI
